Todo Flutter app
Pretty simplistic. Used android studio, no huge difference between that and Visual Studio Code on the laptop.



State management is just passing the list around for now which will not scale out but is simple.

Current functionality:
 - Generate a list (5 values for now)
 - Delete by icon
 - Delete by swipe
 - Read only view at item
 - Add of item
 - Ability to edit an existing item

Still to be worked on.
  - make create screen cleaner
  - Drag and drop of tasks
  - Making the task interface cleaner
  - Improved state management
